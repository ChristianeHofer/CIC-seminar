# Seasonal Adjustment with JDemetra+
Welcome to the fascinating world of seasonal adjustment with JDemetra+ (JD+). **Please note that this site is still under construction.**

## Contents
This repository is basically a collection of course material used in various Bundesbank trainings on seasonal adjustment. These trainings are hosted by the [Centre for International Central Bank Dialogue](https://www.bundesbank.de/en/bundesbank/international-central-bank-dialogue) (CIC) and cover the annual introductory seminar `Elementary seasonal adjustment of economic data with JDemetra+` (Level I) and the biennial advanced seminar `Advanced topics in seasonal adjustment` (Level II). The folder structure is as follows:

- `Year Level I/II`: PDF presentation slides and additional files, such as data files provided by the participants
- `Literature`: selected literature on seasonal adjustment topics covered in at least one of the two seminars
